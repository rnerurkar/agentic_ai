Google ADK Human Verifier Agent - Stage 5 of Document Generation Pipeline

This agent demonstrates advanced ADK patterns for human-in-the-loop workflows and 
deployment orchestration, showing how to build production-ready agents that 
seamlessly integrate human oversight with automated processing.

FOR ADK BEGINNERS - WHAT THIS AGENT DOES:

This is Stage 5 of our document generation pipeline and serves as the central
orchestrator for all human verification workflows. When any stage in the pipeline
requires human review, this agent manages the entire verification process.

Think of this like having a project manager who:
1. Receives requests for human review from all automated stages
2. Creates structured review sessions with proper context
3. Notifies the right experts through their preferred channels
4. Tracks review progress and decisions
5. Routes approved work to the next stage automatically
6. Handles rejections with feedback loops for improvement
7. Orchestrates final deployment when everything is approved

ADVANCED ADK CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED:

1. **Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration**:
   - Centralized management of all human verification workflows
   - Context-aware review session creation
   - Multi-channel notification systems (email, Slack, webhooks)
   - Structured decision tracking and audit trails

2. **Conversational AI Integration**:
   - Dialogflow CX integration for intelligent review conversations
   - Natural language interaction for review feedback
   - Automated context gathering and presentation
   - Smart routing based on expertise and availability

3. **Deployment Automation**:
   - Automated GitHub Pull Request creation
   - Infrastructure deployment orchestration
   - Status tracking in graph database
   - Stakeholder notification and communication

4. **Quality Feedback Loops**:
   - Rejection handling with detailed feedback capture
   - Continuous improvement through review analytics
   - Pattern recognition for common review issues
   - Automated quality improvement suggestions

5. **Multi-Stage Workflow Management**:
   - Universal verification handler for all pipeline stages
   - Stage-specific review processes and criteria
   - Dependency management between review stages
   - Parallel and sequential review coordination

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Maintains quality through expert human oversight
- Reduces review bottlenecks through automation
- Provides audit trails for compliance and governance
- Enables continuous improvement through feedback analytics
- Scales human expertise across large development teams

REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS:
- Code review automation and orchestration
- Architecture review workflows
- Compliance and security approval processes
- Multi-stakeholder approval workflows
- Deployment gate management and automation

HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION PATTERNS:
- AI handles routine tasks, humans focus on strategic decisions
- Contextual information preparation for efficient human review
- Automated routing based on expertise and workload
- Feedback integration for continuous AI improvement
- Seamless handoff between automated and manual processes

    Stage 5: Advanced Human-in-the-Loop Workflow Management and Deployment Orchestration
    
    This agent demonstrates production-level ADK patterns for human-AI collaboration:
    
    **ARCHITECTURE PATTERN - Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration**:
    Human oversight is critical for quality and compliance in AI systems. This involves:
    1. **Context Preparation**: Gather and present relevant information for human review
    2. **Intelligent Routing**: Route requests to appropriate experts based on content
    3. **Conversational Interface**: Enable natural language interaction for reviews
    4. **Decision Tracking**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails of all decisions
    5. **Feedback Integration**: Use human feedback to improve automated processes
    
    **WORKFLOW STAGES**:
    Review Request → Context Assembly → Expert Notification → Human Review → Decision Processing → Action Execution
    
    **KEY ADK PATTERNS**:
    - **Universal Review Handler**: Single agent manages all verification workflows
    - **Conversational AI**: Natural language interface for complex reviews
    - **Smart Routing**: Expertise-based assignment and load balancing
    - **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive tracking for compliance and analytics
    - **Deployment Orchestration**: Automated execution of approved workflows
    
    **FOR ADK BEGINNERS**:
    This is like having a smart assistant that manages all the times you need
    expert human input in your automated processes, making sure the right people
    review the right things at the right time, and then executing the decisions.
